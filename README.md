# WhyTx: The Rationale Engine for Every On-chain Action

**Turns opaque blockchain transactions into readable, auditable stories ‚Äî and pays you DataCoin when others buy your verified rationale bundles.**

---

## The Problem: Transactions are Opaque

On-chain transactions are powerful but fundamentally unreadable for most users. A long hexadecimal string tells you *what* happened, but it fails to explain the most important thing: **_Why?_**

This opacity is a major barrier to adoption, security, and auditing. Users can't easily verify what they are signing, and analysts spend hours manually reconstructing the intent behind complex contract interactions.

## The Solution: WhyTx Agent

**WhyTx** is an AI agent that decodes any on-chain transaction and provides a simple, human-readable rationale. It acts as a translator between complex blockchain events and clear human intent.

Simply paste a transaction hash, and our agent will return:
* ‚úÖ **A Plain-English Rationale:** A 2-3 sentence story explaining the likely purpose of the transaction (e.g., "This was a token swap on Uniswap to hedge against a recent price drop.").
* üîé **Key Evidence:** A summary of the most important on-chain events, such as token transfers, contract interactions, and approvals.
* üõ°Ô∏è **Confidence Score:** A score indicating how confident the agent is in its conclusion, helping users gauge the certainty of the rationale.

Users can then choose to contribute this AI-generated rationale to a larger dataset, earning **DataCoin** when analytics firms, auditors, or other agents purchase access to this valuable, labeled data.
